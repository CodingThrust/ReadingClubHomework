### Integer Solutions Form a Lattice
For a fixed \(A x_p = b \), the set of all integer solutions is:
\[ \{ x_p + x_h \mid Ax_h = 0, x_h \in \mathbb{Z}^d \}. \]

The set \( \{ x_h \mid Ax_h = 0, x_h \in \mathbb{Z}^d \} \) is the set of integer solutions to the homogeneous system \( Ax = 0 \). This is a sublattice of \( \mathbb{Z}^d \) (a lattice contained within \( \mathbb{Z}^d \)) because:
1. It is closed under addition: if \( x_h, x_h' \) satisfy \( Ax_h = 0 \) and \( Ax_h' = 0 \), then \( A(x_h + x_h') = 0 \).
2. It is closed under integer scaling: if \( Ax_h = 0 \) and \( k \in \mathbb{Z} \), then \( A(k x_h) = 0 \).
3. It is discrete because \( \mathbb{Z}^d \) is discrete.

Thus, the set of integer solutions to \( Ax = b \) is a translate (by \( x_p \)) of a sublattice of \( \mathbb{Z}^d \), which is itself a lattice.


We need to find one integer solution \( x_p \) to \( Ax = b \). This can be done using the SVD of \( A \)
\[ A = U S V \]

The system \( Ax = b \) becomes:
\[ U S V x = b \implies S (V x) = U^{-1} b. \]
Let \( y = V x \) and \( b' = U^{-1} b \). Then the system is:
\[ S y = b'. \]

This system is easy to solve because \( S \) is diagonal.

Given that the set of integer solutions is a lattice \( \{ x_p + \sum_{i=1}^{d-r} k_i v_i \mid k_i \in \mathbb{Z} \} \), the optimization problem becomes:
\[ \max c^T (x_p + \sum_{i=1}^{d-r} k_i v_i). \]

This is equivalent to:
\[ \max \sum_{i=1}^{d-r} (c^T v_i) k_i + c^T x_p. \]

Since \( k_i \in \mathbb{Z} \), this is an unbounded problem unless \( c^T v_i = 0 \) for all \( i \). If \( c^T v_i \neq 0 \) for some \( i \), we can make \( c^T x \) arbitrarily large by choosing \( k_i \) appropriately (positive or negative depending on the sign of \( c^T v_i \)). 

Thus:
1. If \( c^T v_i = 0 \) for all \( i \), then \( c^T x = c^T x_p \) is constant over all solutions, and \( x_p \) is optimal.
2. Otherwise, the problem is unbounded.
