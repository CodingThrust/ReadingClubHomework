# according to hint, when formula is satisfied, we have 1/2 - y_0/3 <= y_i <= 1/2 +y_0
# and to minimize f(x) need to maximize (y_i-1/2)^2, which is y_i at its upper bound and gives (y_i - 1/2)^2 = y_0^2, that gives lower bound of f(x) = -1/2y_0^2
# on the other hand if the formula is not satisfied, the bound of y_i is 1/2 - y_0/3 <= y_i <= 1/2 +y_0, and the maximum of f(x) is sum y_0^2 - y_0^2/9  - 1/2n * n * -y_0^2/9 = 7/18 y_0^2
# Q: is p(x) missing 1/n?
