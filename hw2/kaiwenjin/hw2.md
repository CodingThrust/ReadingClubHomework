###### Original problem

Let us present a rigorous proof. Let $\sigma(Z) = (\lambda_1,..,\lambda_n)$ denote the eigenvalues of Z.
$${\rm Tr}(I + \varepsilon Z) = \prod_{i=1}^n (1 + \varepsilon \lambda_i)\approx1+\varepsilon\sum_{i=1}^n\lambda_i$$

$$\Longrightarrow V(I+\varepsilon Z) = -\log\left(\prod_{i=1}^n (1 + \varepsilon \lambda_i)\right) \approx -\sum_{i=1}^n\log(1 + \varepsilon \lambda_i) \approx -\varepsilon\sum_{i=1}^n\lambda_i$$

$$\Longrightarrow V(X + \varepsilon Y) = V(X) + V(I + \varepsilon X^{-1}Y) \approx V(X) - \varepsilon{\rm Tr}(X^{-1}Y)$$

Thus, we have completed the proof.


###### Cramer's rule
Consider a linear system
$$Ax = b,A\in\mathbb{R^{n\times n}},b\in\mathbb{R^n},\det(A)\neq 0$$
Let $x$ denote its solution, and let $A_i$ represent the matrix obtained by replacing the $i$-th column of $A$ with $b$. We can derive:
$$\det(A+\varepsilon b e_i^T) = \det(A)\det(I+\varepsilon A^{-1}b e_i^T)$$

$$\approx\det(A)(1+\varepsilon{\rm Tr}(A^{-1}b e_i^T)) = \det(A)(1+x_i)$$

$$\Longrightarrow x_i \approx \frac{\det(A+\varepsilon b e_i^T)-\det(A)}{\varepsilon\det(A)}\to\frac{\det(A_i)}{\det(A)}$$

This completes our derivation of Cramer's rule.

This problem requires further clarification as its meaning is not immediately clear.

### 9.27
###### 1. 
Let us define $x_0$ as an integer solution and 
$$\ker_N = \ker(A)\cap\mathbb{N}^n$$

We can then establish that $x_0+\ker_N$ forms a lattice.

###### 2.
Through Gaussian elimination, we can efficiently determine an integer solution $x_0$ and a rational basis $K_Q$ of $\ker(A)$ in polynomial time. By multiplying $K_Q$ by the least common multiple (LCM) of the denominators of all its elements (with all rational elements reduced to their simplest form), we obtain an integer basis $K_Z$. Consequently, we can construct the lattice $x_0+{\rm span}_N(K_Z)$ in polynomial time.

###### 3.
If
$$\exists x\in K_N ~~s.t.~~c^Tx\neq 0$$

then we can conclude that the optimal value of the LP must be $+\infty$.

Conversely, if no such vector exists, then every vector in $x_0+{\rm span}(K_Z)$ constitutes an optimal solution of the LP.

Therefore, we can conclude that the IP can be solved in polynomial time.
